# Virtual Cam

A phone sending video from its camera to a VR App on a different phone needs to move itself according to the head movement of the person using the VR App. This is a project that implements dual axis motion accoring to the inputs it receives from wifi/bluetooth module.
There is also provision to send the sensor information of the phone sending video to better enable Synchronization of the movement and video.
